If that character completes the line, `rl_callback_read_char` will invoke the `lhandler` function installed by `rl_callback_handler_install` to process the line. Before calling the `lhandler` function, the terminal settings are reset to the values they had before calling `rl_callback_handler_install`. If the `lhandler` function returns, and the line handler remains installed, the terminal settings are modified for Readline's use again.
