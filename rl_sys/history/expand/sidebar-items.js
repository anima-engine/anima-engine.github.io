initSidebarItems({"fn":[["arg_extract","Extract a string segment consisting of the `first` through `last` arguments present in string `s`. Arguments are split using `history_tokenize`. If either `first` or `last` is < 0, then make that arg count from the right (subtract from the number of tokens, so that `first` = -1 means the next to last token on the line). If `first` and `last` are 36 (ASCII '$') the last arg from string `s` is used."],["expand","Expand string, placing the result into `output`, a pointer to a string (see section 1.1 History Expansion)."],["get_event","Returns the text of the history event beginning at `s + *idx`. `*idx` is modified to point to after the event specifier. At function entry, `*idx` points to the index into string where the history event specification begins. `add_delim` is a character that is allowed to end the event specification in addition to the \"normal\" terminating characters."],["tokenize","Return an array of tokens parsed out of string `s`, much as the shell might. The tokens are split on the characters in the `history_word_delimiters` variable, and shell quoting conventions are obeyed."]]});
